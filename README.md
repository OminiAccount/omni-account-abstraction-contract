Our smart contracts are developed by extending an open-source [contract library](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction). We have streamlined the original implementation by removing unnecessary business modules, replaced the original deposit module, and added new cross-chain functionality using LayerZeroV2 and zk verification modules.
