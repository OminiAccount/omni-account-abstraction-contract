 * A custom revert error of handleOps, to identify the offending op.

 * Useful for mitigating DoS attempts against batchers or for troubleshooting of factory/account/paymaster reverts.
 * NOTE: If simulateValidation passes successfully, there should be no reason for handleOps to fail on it.
 * @param opIndex - Index into the array of ops to the failed one (in simulateValidation, this is always zero).
 * @param reason  - Revert reason. The string starts with a unique code "AAmn",
 *                  where "m" is "1" for factory, "2" for account and "3" for paymaster issues,
 *                  so a failure can be attributed to the correct entity.
